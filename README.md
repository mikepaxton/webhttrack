My docker compose file for building a webhttrack container on my Raspberry Pi

The default external port is 8110 but this can be changed.
Currently all downloaded or mirrored content is mapped to the /data/httrack directory.  
Make sure the /data/directory has  plenty of room for these files.
Access to httrack can be found under App. Launcher --> Internet --> Httrack-builder & httrack viewer
