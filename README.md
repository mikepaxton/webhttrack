My docker compose file for building a webhttrack container on my Raspberry Pi

The default external port is 8120 but this can be changed.
Currently all downloaded or mirrored content is mapped to the /mnt/cyberserver/www/html/httrack directory.  
Access to httrack can be found under App. Launcher --> Internet --> Httrack-builder & httrack viewer
